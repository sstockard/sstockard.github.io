## About Me

I am a detail-oriented, motivated, and results-driven Research Data Analyst at The Ohio State University. My current research involves using computational methods to analyze large scale genomic data in breast cancer, applying analytical methods that are relevant to many fields.

**Technical Skills:** I most commonly program in R, but am proficient in Python, C++, SQL. I am also familiar with SPSS and JMP.

**Relevant Coursework:** Introduction to Bioinformatics, Analysis of  Large-Scale Genomic Data, Introduction to C++, SQL Fundamentals, Research and Problem Solving, Fundamentals of Grant Writing.
